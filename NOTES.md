# Priority Tasks

1) Change Movement to continue in the direction of the mouse from center
    - give indicator of movement direction
    - render player gradient based on mouse pos
    - player speed is still wonky in the Y-axis
    - directionality it suspect now too
        -top right has ceased to function at medium mass;
        - at larger radius, all directionality goes out the window => refactor speed component

    - large players are rendering out of the canvas;

2) Create Scale

3) Create Enemies
